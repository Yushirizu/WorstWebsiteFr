                    <p>
                        Trip to Malta from 29 January to 5 February, for 200-250€ maximum all inclusive, with the return airfare being 70€ and the price of the hotel depending on the number of people you are going to be.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There will be a little more than 100€ left to eat for the whole week knowing that we leave Malta at 6am so 6 days of food consumption.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No further testing for Covid-19 is required for entry into Malta, including for those without a certificate of vaccination or cure.   
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is recommended to follow the instructions of the local authorities (notably on the website of the Ministry of Health, in English) and to consult the website of the French Embassy in Malta.
                        It is also recommended that you take out travel insurance, particularly in relation to Covid 19.
                        Wearing a mask remains mandatory in health facilities. It may be advisable to wear a mask in cramped areas, particularly in transport. In addition, places open to the public, such as shops, remain free to ask their customers to wear a mask.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a reminder, the risk of an attack is high and French residents or visitors abroad are asked to be as vigilant as possible.

                        In particular, they should stay away from all gatherings and be careful when travelling. It is also recommended to keep informed of the situation and the risks, by consulting the recommendations in the Travel Advice.

                        French people passing through are invited to register on the Ariane feed, in order to receive alerts concerning the country they are in.
